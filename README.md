## Usage
To use this application you will type your desired item into the search bar. Once the item is in the search bar, depending on weather it is a food or a drink, you click the corresponding button. Once the button is clicked, it will display the results of your search and give you the option to save/remove any of the results. When you choose which one of the results you would like to save, then it will add that to your list of saved items so that you can see them at any time. You can use the navbar at the top to move between the landing page and the saved recipes page so that you can view your recipes at any time as well as go back to the homepage.
